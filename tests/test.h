/* The CHECK macro evaluates a result against an expecation as one

   expected to execute in a function where a test_result is returned.
   Provide the resulting operation against the expected outcome. The
   types must be comparable with ==/!=. Finally, provide the type and
   format specifier for the types being compared which also must be
   the same for both RESULT and EXPECTED (e.g. int, "%d", size_t, "%zu",
   bool, "%b"). If RESULT or EXPECTED are function calls they will only
