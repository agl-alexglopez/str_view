@brief The `SV_Str_view` Interface

A `SV_Str_view` is a read only view of null terminated C strings. It's purpose
is to provide robust read only string construction, tokenizing, and matching.
This introduces tremendous flexibility to string handling in C programming from
low-level kernel code to application layer programming.

Read only string handling offers many safety benefits as well. All functions in
the interface are either constant or pure functions. This means that given the
same inputs, they will provide the same outputs. And because no functions can
modify the underlying string, compilers can often help use these guarantees
to produce faster code. This also means that all string view functions are
inherently safe to be used from multiple threads over the same string data.

This interface also aims to provide robust read only tokenization without any of
the concerns that come with functions like `strtok` versus `strtok_r`.
Tokenization can occur simultaneously from multiple threads and a natural
iteration abstraction is provided.

Finally, all major string matching functions are provided and run in linear
time, using constant space. There are also variants of the substring matching
algorithms that run in reverse providing the optimal time complexity for reverse
string matching. Constant space complexity is an important component of
maintaining the pure attributes of the searching function. Regardless of the
underlying string matching algorithm, no side effects occur and no auxiliary
global or static global storage is needed. */
